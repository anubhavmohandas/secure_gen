## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.6+
- 💻 Basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts
- 📦 pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Magic ✨
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anubhavmohandas/secure_gen.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd secure_gen

# Run the installation script
bash ./install.sh
```

The installation script will:
- Check and install Python if needed
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all required dependencies
- Download payload collections from various sources
- Set up the `payloadfor` command utility
- Create necessary directory structure

### Dependencies
- prettytable (for formatted display)
- requests (for payload downloads)
- pycryptodome (for cryptographic operations)
- click (for command-line interface)

## 🎮 Usage

### Main Payload Generator
```bash
./run.sh
```

### PayloadFor Command Utility
The framework includes a powerful `payloadfor` utility to quickly access payloads for specific vulnerability types:

```bash
payloadfor xss              # List all XSS payloads
payloadfor sqli --random    # Show a random SQL injection payload
payloadfor rce --limit 5    # Show 5 RCE payloads
payloadfor lfi --filter php # Show LFI payloads containing 'php'
```

Options:
- `-c, --count`: Show the count of available payloads
- `-r, --random`: Show a random payload
- `-l, --limit N`: Limit output to N payloads
- `-f, --filter STR`: Filter payloads containing STR

## 🧠 Programmatic Usage

You can also use the framework programmatically in your Python scripts:

```python
from enhanced_payload_gen import PayloadGenerator

# Initialize the generator
generator = PayloadGenerator()

# Generate SQL injection payloads for MySQL
sql_payloads = generator.generate_sql_injection(database_type='mysql', 
                                               authentication_method='login')

# Generate XSS payloads for DOM context
xss_payloads = generator.generate_xss_payloads(context='dom')

# Generate RCE payloads for Linux systems
rce_payloads = generator.generate_rce_payloads(os_type='linux', 
                                              command='id')

# Export payloads to file
generator.export_payloads(payload_type='sql_injection', format='json', 
                         output_file='mysql_payloads.json')
```

## 📋 Advanced Usage Examples

### Password Generation
```bash
# Generate password list
./run.sh --password-gen --name "John Doe" --dob 19900115 --output passwords.txt
```

### SQL Injection Payloads
```bash
# Explore potential SQL injection techniques
./run.sh --sql --database mysql --context login
```

### Remote Code Execution Payloads
```bash
# Understand RCE vulnerability vectors
./run.sh --rce --os linux --command "cat /etc/passwd"
```

## 🔒 Advanced Features

### Evasion Techniques
The framework implements multiple evasion techniques to bypass security controls:

- **SQL Injection**: Comment insertion, case randomization, alternative syntax
- **XSS**: Unicode encoding, HTML entity encoding, script fragmentation
- **RCE**: Environment variable substitution, command concatenation, whitespace alternatives

### Payload Directory Structure
The installation creates the following payload directories:
```
payloads/
├── xss/
├── sqli/
├── csrf/
├── ssrf/
├── xxe/
├── rce/
├── lfi/
